# Flask Localization Project

This project is a Flask-based web application that demonstrates how to implement localization and internationalization (i18n) in a web application using Flask, Flask-Babel, and pytz. The main goal of this project is to provide a simple example of how to parametrize Flask templates to display content in different languages, infer the correct locale based on various factors, and localize timestamps.

## Resources

Before you start with this project, it's recommended to read or watch the following resources:

- [Flask-Babel Documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Babel/)
- [Flask i18n Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xiii-i18n-and-l10n)
- [pytz Documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/pytz/)

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to ensure the following requirements are met:

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.7).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5).
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- All your `.py` files should be executable.
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`).
- All your functions and methods should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`).
- A documentation is not a simple word; itâ€™s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified).
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-localization-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd flask-localization-project
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The Flask application should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

Here are some tips on how to use this Flask Localization Project:

- Access the application through your web browser, and you will see the default content in the default language.
- Experiment with changing the language in the URL or by adjusting user settings to see how the content is localized.
