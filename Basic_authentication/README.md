# Basic authentication :rocket:

## Description :page_with_curl:

This project focuses on implementing authentication mechanisms in a REST API using Python and Flask. It covers the concept of authentication, Base64 encoding, Basic authentication, and sending the Authorization header in HTTP requests.

## Learning Objectives :brain:

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without needing external assistance:

### General :bulb:

1. **Authentication**:
   - Understand what authentication means in the context of web applications.
   
2. **Base64**:
   - Comprehend the purpose of Base64 encoding.
   - Know how to encode a string using Base64.

3. **Basic Authentication**:
   - Understand the concept of Basic authentication and its use in web services.
   - Know how to send Basic authentication credentials in HTTP requests using the Authorization header.

## Requirements :clipboard:

### Python Scripts :snake:

1. **Python Version** :snake:: All Python scripts should be compatible with Python 3 (version 3.7).
2. **New Lines** :new:: Ensure that all your files end with a new line for consistency.
3. **Shebang Line** :hash:: The first line of all your Python files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
4. **README.md** :page_facing_up:: A `README.md` file must be present at the root of the project folder, containing project documentation.
5. **Code Style** :art:: Your code should adhere to the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5) for clean and readable code.
6. **Executable Files** :rocket:: All your Python files must be executable.
7. **File Length** :scroll:: Be mindful of the length of your files, which will be tested using the `wc` command.
8. **Documentation for Modules** :book:: Every module in your project should have
